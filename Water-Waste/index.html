      <h1>Jeans and Water</h1>
      <p>
        Influencer Grace Mandeville presents a new short form docu-series for
        BBC iPlayer to see whether we can still enjoy the thrill of shopping for
        fashion while doing it consciously and sustainably. Grace Mandeville
        learns how many thousands of litres of water go into a single item of
        clothes and questions whether to stop wearing jeans.

      <h1>Denim's Water Footprint</h1>

      <p>
        We may simply think of a worn pair of blue jeans as an old friend, but
        may not put a lot of thought into how those jeans were made. In fact, a
        great deal of water goes into growing cotton, washing it, and dyeing it
        blue. The lion’s share of the fashion sector’s worldwide water use is
        for cotton cultivation and wet textile processes like bleaching, dyeing,
        printing, and finishing, and global production of cotton is estimated to
        use 222 billion m³/y of water. It is also estimated that 20% of
        industrial water pollution is associated with garment manufacturing, and
        85% of that is associated with an annual 1.3 trillion gallons for dyeing
        processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fashion industry, however, is becoming progressively more conscious
        of sustainability. Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Everlane manufactures its jeans in the clean-energy Saitex factory,
            which reuses 98% of water. With a global average at 1,500 L for a
            pair of blue jeans, Everlane’s 0.4 L figure is remarkable.
            Outerknown S.E.A. jeans are also made at Saitex with 100% organic
            cotton.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Taylor Stitch also uses organic cotton to produce its ’68 Denim with
            water, energy, and chemically efficient processes.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Levi Strauss Company is stepping up with a laser dyeing method,
            which is touted to reduce water consumption in dyeing by 71%.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Wrangler also rolled out a new Dry Indigo® denim. The foam process
            eliminates 99% of the water used to dye denim. The process was
            developed at Texas Tech, with early-stage funding from Wrangler and
            the Walmart Foundation, with Spanish company Tejidos Royo milling
            and shipping the jeans.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Levi’s Better Cotton Initiative has been training farmers to be more
            water efficient since 2001, and its “Water &lt; Less” processes have
            reused upwards of 2 billion L of water and have included the use of
            15% recycled cotton or more in Levi’s jeans. Levis hopes to
            sustainably source 100% of its cotton and is recycling old jeans as
            insulation with partner Cotton’s Blue Jeans Go Green. Levi’s also
            has compiled perhaps the most comprehensive estimate of water used
            throughout the life cycle of a pair of blue jeans. From farming to
            final disposal, one pair of 501® jeans requires 3,781 L of water,
            including laundering.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Cotton Farming</h2>
      <p>
        While those advances are laudable, most water used for blue jeans is for
        cotton irrigation and is considered “virtual water” because it is often
        overlooked in water footprint calculations. Global textile production
        requires an estimated 44 trillion L of water yearly for irrigation,
        about 3% of all irrigation, 95% of which is for growing cotton. Cotton
        irrigation makes up 92% of the water footprint of a pair of jeans.
      </p>
      <p>
        About half of local water impacts from cotton are from foreign demand.
        An estimated 20% of water loss from the disappeared Aral Sea was a
        result of EU cotton consumption, and the fashion sector accounts for 7%
        of local groundwater and drinking water depletion globally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most sources say it takes 10,000-20,000 L of water to produce 1 kg of
        cotton, but some cotton advocates claim that cotton water footprint
        estimates are inflated, pointing out that cotton can grow in very dry
        climates. The International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) estimates a
        kilogram of ginned cotton only requires about 1,214 L to irrigate, and
        41.3% of cotton production does not require irrigation.
      </p>

      <h2>Water Use in Denim Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>
        After cotton is removed from bales, it is carded (run through brushing
        machines), spun into yarn, and dyed, usually with a synthetic indigo.
        Large balls of cotton called “ball warps” are repeatedly dipped in a vat
        of dye, forming dye layers. The cotton yarn is “slashed,” or coated with
        a starchy sizing to stiffen it, then blue and white yarns are woven on
        shuttleless looms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The production is water-intensive, but some jeans are also prewashed or
        stonewashed, creating compounds that must be disposed of, like chlorine,
        and organic pollutants like dye and starch. These shouldn’t be
        discharged untreated into surface water because resultant oxygen
        depletion would harm aquatic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Streams still run blue in many areas where denim is manufactured.
