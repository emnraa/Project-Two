      <h1>How Are Jeans Made? The Manufacturing Process by History of Jeans</h1>
      <img src="/images/Jean Production.jpg" alt="Jean Production image" />
      <p>
        Everything starts with ginning of cotton. Cotton is picked from fields
        and processed and baled. Bales are opened and separated into small
        tufts. Then, after it is removed from tightly packed bales and
        inspected, cotton goes, by means of by air suction, to carding. It goes
        to the machine with bent wire brushes called cards. They are doing
        cleaning from foreign matter, disentangling, straightening, and
        gathering the cotton threads into slivers. Those slivers go to spinning
        machines that twist and stretch the cotton slivers forming yarn from
        them. Some of that yarn is dyed with chemically synthesized indigo dye
        few times so the color would last longer. After dyeing yarn is
        “slashed”. It is coated with sizing (a type of starchy substance) which
        makes the threads stronger and stiffer. The dyed and white yarn is then
        woven on large shuttle-less looms. Blue threads that form the warp are
        packed closer together than the white ones, which form the weft, so the
        resulting cloth is blue. Cloth of this type is called “denim”.
      </p>
      <p>
        After it is woven, denim is ready for so-called finishing which means it
        is brushed to remove loose threads and lint, skewed which prevents it
        from twisting and preshrunk. Denim cloth is then stacked 100 layers
        thick and cut with high speed cutting machines into pieces needed for
        desired designs of jeans. A pair of blue jeans has some ten different
        pieces from which they are sewn, like pockets, leg panels, waistband and
        belt loops. Pieces are sewn on the assembly line of industrial
        human-operated sewing machines where each place on the assembly line is
        assigned a specific function and does one job, and all the pieces are
        sewn into a pair of jeans. Jeans are then prewashed or stone-washed if
        needed. Prewashing is done in industrial detergent and makes denim
        softer. Stone-washing gives faded look. It can be done with smaller or
        bigger stones. Smaller stones fade jeans more evenly while bigger give
        more uneven texture and lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Denim can also be sprayed with sand or chemicals during the wash process
        to create a worn-out appearance. A finished pair of jeans is then
        pressed in large pressing machines that press whole pants at once. After
        those jeans are boxed according to style, color, and size and sent to
        the warehouse. From warehouse boxes of jeans are sent to stores.
        Byproducts of manufacturing are treated according to their
        biodegradability. Biodegradable ones can be dumped into nature while
        those that are not (like starch and dye) must be processed in compliance
        with all relevant government regulations.

        Blue Jeans are usually made out of 100 percent cotton, but there are
        types of blue jeans that have synthetic in them. One of those types is
        stretch jeans which have 3% of elastane which makes them stretchy.
        Rivets are made of copper, while the zippers, snaps, and buttons are
        usually steel. Labels are made out of cloth, leather or plastic, and
        embroidered with cotton thread.
