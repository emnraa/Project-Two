      <h1>Alternatives to Jeans</h1>
      <p>
        Jeans, no doubt, are the staple of any person's closet- man or woman.
        Why not add variety? There are many alternatives to jeans that not only
        help save the planet, but also add a lit bit of variety to your
        wardrobe:

        While these are excellent subsitutes for jeans, it may be an unrealistic
        expectation to believe that we will all stop wearing our favorite closet
        staple altogether.If joggers, trousers or jumpsuits are still not to
        your forte of style, then there are many brands out there making quite
        the effort to transition to environmentally friendly practices:
      </p>

      <p>
        From the pesticides and insecticides used to grow cotton to the massive
        amounts of water, energy, and chemicals used to process the materials
        and turn them into denim, jeans rank as one of the least eco-friendly
        clothing items to make. According to Everlane, it takes about 1,500
        liters (that's roughly 396 gallons) of water to produce a single pair of
        jeans.
      </p>
      <p>
        Realistically, those stats aren't going to prevent anyone from buying
        jeans. But as responsible consumers, we can do our part by shopping
        brands that value sustainability in their production methods. So, to
        point you in the right direction, we rounded up seven brands that are
        making jeans more sustainably by implementing less wasteful
        manufacturing techniques and more effective recycling programs. From
        startups like Frank And Oak and Outerknown to legacy brands like Levi's,
        you won't have a problem finding denim with high-impact style and
        low-impact everything else.
      </p>

      <h2>Everlane</h2>
      <p>
        Everlane has always been about transparency. In addition to prioritizing
        ethical labor practices, it has made sustainability a major tenet of it
        its production process.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll find apparel made from recycled plastic in the ReNew Collection
        along with what the brand calls the "world's lowest-impact sneakers"
        from its shoe line, Tread. But jeans are another area Everlane has made
        huge strides in as far as sustainability goes. The jeans are made in
        Saitex, the world's cleanest denim factory. The facility recycles 98% of
        its water and uses clean energy. After the water is recycled, Everlane's
        jeans use 0.4 liters of water compared to the whopping 1,500 liters of
        water per pair when using traditional production methods.
      </p>

      <h2>Levi's</h2>
      <p>
        In 2010, Levi's launched the Better Cotton Initiative, which trains
        farmers to use less water, pesticides, insecticides, and synthetic
        fertilizers when growing cotton plants. Currently, more than 20% of the
        cotton Levi's uses — not just for its denim, but for its apparel as well
        — is qualified as Better Cotton, and they're rapidly growing that
        percentage. By 2020, the brand hopes to use cotton from sustainable
        sources in 100% of its products.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of manufacturing, Levi's Water < Less techniques have done a
        lot to benefit the environment. So far, Levi's has saved more than 3
        billion liters of water and recycled more than 2 billion liters of
        water. To date, more than 67% of Levi's products are made with Water <
        Less techniques and by 2020, the goal is to increase that to 80%.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brand also recently teamed up with Cotton's Blue Jeans Go Green
        program to save old denim from landfills by turning it into insulation
        for homes and buildings.
      </p>

      <h2>Frank and Oat</h2>
      <p>
        In 2012, childhood friends Ethan Song and Hicham Ratnani founded Frank
        And Oak with the simple goal of helping men dress better with affordably
        priced clothing. After far exceeding its initial goal, the brand
        launched a women's line and set out to actively reduce its carbon
        footprint — and denim is one of its main areas of focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        By teaming up with Hydro-Less Laundry, an eco-certified factory in
        Dubai, Frank And Oak's denim production uses 79% less energy, 50% fewer
        chemicals, and 95% less water than traditional manufacturing techniques.
        While its conservation efforts are comparable to other brands making
        sustainable jeans, Frank And Oak stands out with its affordable price.
      </p>

      <p>
        Regardless of what fit or wash you choose, you can get a pair of Frank
        And Oak jeans for $89.50 or less.
